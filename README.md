## Yo feature added
Changing Yo priority

## Ethical Issues
1. **Avoid harm.** The developers of the Yo app have the ethical resposibility to avoid harm to its users. This can be an issue for the 
Yo app creators because they know that not all users may be using the Yo app for a simple greeting. Some people who are in danger zones
may be using the app to alert the people around them when there is danger. The developers must do their best to make sure their app is 
working correctly at all times as to make sure this does not mess up and cause harm to someone in this sitation. The Yo priority feature
is something that would hopefully help with users who are in this situation.
2. **Be fair and take action not to discriminate.** In the Yo app, the developers have the ethical responsibility to not discriminate. 
If the developers were to use the information they collect on the location of a Yo user or the time spent on the Yo app and create 
discrimination to its users based on that when it comes to updates to faulty systems, this would be a big ethical issue.
3. **Respect privacy.** Another ethical issue that the Yo developers would run into is that they would need to make sure they respect 
the privacy of the user. Even in a case where the developers would like to know some extra information about the user, if they have not
made an agreement with the user on using this data, it would be unethical to do so.

## Legal Issues 
1. **Privacy** The developers of the Yo app have some legal issues that they need to look out for when it comes to privacy. If they were
to watch what a user is doing while they are on the Yo app, they would need to disclose this to the users or they may have some legal
issues. If a user were to worry about their privacy and a legal issue were to come up, according to the PIPA for South Korea, the Yo 
app would be required to give documentation on all the information they have saved and who they have shared it with.
2. **Data Gathering** The Yo application is one of many that requires some of your personal information to sign up, such as your name,
email, or phone number. It is shown that data is also collected on the amount of Yo's sent between the users. Other things they could 
collect are the amount of high priority Yos that are sent or when they were sent. If the developers do not make it clear to the user
that they are collecting this data they can have legal issues. In South Korea, according to the PIPA, companies must disclose exactly 
what data they are collecting and what they plan on doing with this data. If they are just going to display it for the users' friends 
or if they are going to be giving it to other outside sources, then this would need to be disclosed.
3. **Security Liability** With the Yo app being one that takes a lot of the users personal information such as name, email address, 
and phone number, as well as occasionally the location and banking information, the developers need to look out for the security of the 
users. This is because if something were to happen and this app were to become unsecure, legal issues would arise. In South Korea, 
according to the PIPA, companies must immediately alert the users if something has changed based on the workings of the app or a change 
in who has access to their data. This would be a legal responsibility that the developers of Yo would have if a security issue were to 
arise.

## Professional Issues
1. **Accept and provide appropriate professional review.** The Yo app is one that is easily availabe through the different app stores on
different devices. Because of this users and other professionals are easily able to contact the creators and give them their feedback on
the Yo app. It is in the professional responsibility of the developers to look at this feedback and take it into account when updating 
their app. If a new feature, such as the Yo priority, were to be unpleasing to the users, the developers should be professional and take
this into consideration. 
2. **Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.** The developers of the Yo 
app have the professional responsibilty to let the users know the details of how the Yo app works and the consequences of using it. 
For the users to be fully disclosed with how their data is being used, which is how the law in South Korea demands it be, they must 
know what data is being collected and who is seeing it. To fully understand this, the developers must make it easy for the users to 
understand the computing behind what is being collected and what is not during the users time on the app. The developers of Yo should 
also make sure the users understand the Yo priority correctly and do not misinterpret it.
3. **Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.** To prevent a security leak that would lead to legal issues, 
the developers of Yo have the professional responsbility to first create an app that is secure. Before releasing any new changes to 
the Yo app they must first make sure that this is going to keep the users information secure.
